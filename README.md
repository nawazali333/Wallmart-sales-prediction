# Wallmart-sales-prediction

 historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.

# Pre-requisites

   Python
   Data Visualization
   Descriptive Statistics
   Machine Learning
   Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

 # How Are We Going to Build This?
 
-We will handle missing values present in the dataset during the data cleaning stage.
-We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using various visualization techniques 
 to identify underlying patterns and correlations that can help us derive insights.
-Further, we will train and develop multiple regressor ML models, such as XGBoost Regressor model,
 LGBMRegressor,etc and compare their performance based on the modelâ€™s accuracy and RMSE.
